                Girl with a Pearl Earring is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter<i> Johannes Vermeer, </i>
                dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present 
                title towards the end of the 20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there. 
                The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been 
                the subject of various literary and cinematic treatments.

                The painting is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a "head" that was 
                not meant to be a portrait. It depicts a European girl wearing "exotic dress", 
                an "oriental turban", and what appears to be a very large pearl as an earring.  
                The subject of the painting is unknown, with it being possible either that 
                she was a real model, or that Vermeer created a more generalised and mysterious woman.
