                The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter 
                <i> Vincent van Gogh, </i> painted in June 1889. It depicts the view from the east-facing window 
                of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of 
                an imaginary village. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art 
                in New York City since 1941.

                Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, 
                it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory.  
                "Through the iron-barred window", he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, 
                "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise 
                in all its glory."
