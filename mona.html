                The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist <i> Leonardo da Vinci. </i>
                It's considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance. The painting has been 
                traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil 
                on a white poplar panel. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506.

                King Francis I of France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the
                property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797. 
                It is one of the most valuable paintings in the world and holds the Guinness World Record 
                for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962, 
                equivalent to $1 billion as of 2023.
